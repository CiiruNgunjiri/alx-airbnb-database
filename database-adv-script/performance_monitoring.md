| Metric          | First Plan   | Second Plan  | Notes                     |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **Execution Time** | 0.270 ms    | 0.088 ms    | Second is ~3x faster      |
| **Planning Time**  | 1.470 ms    | 0.308 ms    | Second is ~5x faster      |
| **Scan Times**     | Slightly slower | Slightly faster | Minor differences       |
| **Overall Result** | Both efficient | Both efficient | Both plans use indexes well |

## Interpretation

- Both query plans efficiently utilize indexes on partitioned tables.
- The second plan demonstrates improved execution and planning times, likely benefiting from caching or system state.
- Minor variations in scan times do not significantly affect overall performance.
- Consistent performance gains can be achieved by maintaining updated statistics and warming caches.
